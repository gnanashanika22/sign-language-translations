# sign-language-translations

A real-time Sign Language Translation Tool that converts hand gestures into readable text, making communication more inclusive for individuals with hearing or speech impairments.

## 🌟 Features

- 📷 Real-time sign detection via webcam
- 🔤 Translates signs to English text
- 🤖 Powered by Machine Learning and Computer Vision
- 💬 Interactive GUI for easy use
- 🧠 Custom model training support
- 📁 Dataset creation & augmentation utilities

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Tkinter / Streamlit (optional)
- **Backend**: Python
- **ML Framework**: TensorFlow / PyTorch
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV
- **Model**: CNN / Custom hand gesture recognition model
